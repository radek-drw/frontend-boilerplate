   ## $ npm install -g npm-check-updates

   b) Or you can run with npx:

   ## $ npx npm-check-updates

2. Usage

   ## $ ncu

   b) Upgrade a project's package file:

   ## $ ncu -u

3. Run npm install to install new versions:

   a) Update installed (or install latest versions) packages and package-lock.json

   ## $ npm install
